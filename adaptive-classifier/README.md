# Adaptive Classifier

This is an algorithm designed specifically with low-power electronics in mind, in particular mobile and embedded systes. Note that the current implementation is just a simulation of the real algorithm -- in reality it is supposed to be implemented in pure hardware (ASIC or FPGA).

## Abstract
Adaptive classifier leverages the wide variability in data complexity to enable energy-efficient data classification operations for mobile systems. It takes advantage of varying classification “hardness” across data to dynamically allocate resources and improve energy efficiency.
