# Machine Learning Algorithms

I will put all machine learning algorithms I work on and develop here. If they are complete, I will say so in the list below.

## Released

- [Adaptive Classifier](adaptive-classifier)


## Work in progress

### Looking for collaborators
If you would like to participate in any of the projects here, please, let me know - I will share the current progress

- Global Mind: Open-source project like SETI@HOME and Folding@HOME, to allow for global mind to emerge from internet (looking for collaborators)
- Bernoulli RBM Dream Machine: Video/Image processing machine that dreams

### Not published or pending
- FoG: highly distributed, resource allocation aware, energy-efficient classifier
- Semi-supervised Online Learning: Bernoulli RBM with assumption input to allow for pipelining in unsupervised learning
- Seeing Machine: Convolutional Visual Cortex with RBM Decision Making
